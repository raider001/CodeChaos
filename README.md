# CodeChaos

## What is this?

Code Chaos is a project intended for a bit of fun as well as an experiment

## How to play

1. Each member has the opportunity to work independently for a week in terms of implementing/extending a code base.
2. That member has full control and discretion of the direction of the code base for that week.
3. That team member can discuss and ask help and guidance on where the code base goes.
4. After a week, the project is handed to the next member.
5. This process continues until we get bored.

## Rules

1. No other members can provide direction or discuss the way they wish to take the code base.
2. The code must compile and run.
3. Logic by other members intent must remain, but it can be extended.
4. Third party open source libraries are ok to use.
5. The end intent of each individual is to remain quiet.
6. Keep it PC, workplace rules apply.

## Project Setup
### Eclipse
1. Open Eclipse, navigate to file/import
2. Select Maven/Existing Maven Projects
3. Right click pom.xml, select Maven and click update project.

You're done!
### IntelliJ
1. Open IntelliJ, select File/Open and select your project.
2. Right click pom.xml, select Maven and click reload project.

You're done!

## Specific Rules

1. Maven will be used to manage dependencies.
2. The project must be Java. This rule may be exempt if other technologies/languages are used to communicate with the
   main java application.

## Future Rules

1. If the project goes on for an extended period of time and the code base grows, it will then be open to be worked on
   by parallel by more than one person.
2. It is up to the discression of each current working members in parallel on if they work with their pair or alone.
3. Working pairs will be randomised.

## Recomendations
1. Push small and push often. Trust me, you dont want to get stuck with a large merge conflict when you don't know what the other person is doing...

## Roster
To try to keep tabs on who's turn it is the following is the roster code chaos roster.
